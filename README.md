Implement Oracle + Futures Contract Dapp

Materials tailored to Ethereum + Nodejs but any Oracle-sourced Futures settlements welcome, platform-agnostic

Using OracleSkeleon.js, FuturesSkeleton.sol as reference connect a data provider( crypto exchange api for example) to a futures contract so that settlement is determined by oracle data

A frontend has been set up for binary futures testing here
https://github.com/zapproject/Hackathon-Armenia/tree/master/frontend

Feel free to provide expanded interface as needed.

Projects will be rated on performance, ingenuity, and scalable patterning

## Serious bonuses for features like
    novel interface,
    SSL verification of oracle data,
    multiple data sources for oracles, fallback etc,
    oracle monetization,
    ERC20 payments,
    futures contract factories,
    oracle data(crypto exchange, etc)
